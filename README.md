This study simulates the potential impact of introducing a 4-point shot in basketball using a statistical approach based on the Dirichlet distribution. All data used in this study were collected from Basketball Reference, NBA Stats, and PBPStats.

Code Structure
Main_code_result: Contains the code used to replicate the results of the 2023-24 NBA season.
Main_code_case1: Implements Case 1 of the 4-point shot simulation.
Uses the same dataset as Main_code_result (Main_data).
Main_code_case2: Implements Case 2 of the 4-point shot simulation.
Uses a different dataset (Main_data_case2).
This repository aims to provide insights into the strategic implications of a 4-point shot in professional basketball through statistical modeling and simulation.
